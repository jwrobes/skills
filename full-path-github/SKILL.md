description: >-
  Confidence-gated orchestrator that takes a raw GitHub issue and delivers a
  reviewed, tested pull request on a personal GitHub project. Chains intake,
  enrichment, planning, execution, validation, and shipping with a three-tier
  confidence model. Use when the user says "full path", "orchestrate", "run
  the full pipeline", "take this issue end to end", or provides a GitHub
  issue URL for autonomous implementation.

# Full Path Orchestrator (GitHub)

Confidence-gated pipeline. Takes a GitHub issue (raw or groomed) and
delivers a reviewed, tested pull request. Stops only when it genuinely
can't proceed — otherwise makes decisions, documents them, and moves on.

This is a personal-projects orchestrator: assumes one repo owner (you),
no SLA, the `gh` CLI for all GitHub interaction, and a `~/personal/{project}/`
worktree convention.

## Intent Detection

| Keywords | Action |
|----------|--------|
| "full path", "orchestrate", "end to end", "take this issue" | Use this skill |
| "run the pipeline on #NNN", "implement this issue" | Use this skill |
| "resume the orchestrator on #NNN" | Resume from last phase |

## Input

| Required | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Issue reference | GitHub issue URL, number, or `owner/repo#NNN` format |
| Project | The repo to implement in (e.g., `jwrobes/some-project`) |

| Optional | Default |
|----------|---------|
| Mode | `auto` (other options: `plan-first`, `build-first`) |
| Branch name | `build-{issue-slug}` |
| Worktree path | `~/personal/{project}/worktrees/{slug}/` |

## Prerequisites

### Skills (at `~/.cursor/skills/` or installed via `install.sh`)

| Skill | Phase | Required |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `grill-me` | Enrich | Yes |
| `structured-backlog` | Plan | Yes |
| `tdd-pocock` | Execute | Yes — the inner TDD loop |
| `code-review` | Enrich + Validate | Yes |
| `scaffold-workspace` | Pre-execute | Optional but recommended |
| `gh-pr-create` | Ship | Yes |

### Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `gh` (GitHub CLI) | Issue + PR + label operations |
| `git` (with worktree support) | Isolated execution environment |

Verify before starting:

```bash
gh auth status
ls ~/.cursor/skills/{grill-me,structured-backlog,tdd-pocock,code-review,gh-pr-create}/SKILL.md
```

## Sub-Skills

This orchestrator is a thin conductor. All phase logic lives in
composable sub-skills under `phases/`. Read them in order as each phase
begins:

```
full-path-github/
├── SKILL.md          # This file
└── phases/
    ├── guardrails.md  # READ FIRST — hard rules, confidence thresholds
    ├── intake.md      # Phase 1 — read issue, find code context
    ├── enrich.md      # Phase 2 — grill-me self-interrogation, pattern eval
    ├── plan.md        # Phase 3 — structured-backlog decomposition
    ├── execute.md     # Phase 4 — TDD loop via tdd-pocock
    ├── validate.md    # Phase 5 — tests + ACs + review rubric
    ├── ship.md        # Phase 6 — PR creation, execution log
    └── retrospect.md  # Phase 7 — friction analysis, skill creation
```

## GitHub State Model (no `state::` labels)

Personal projects don't need a six-state Kanban. The orchestrator uses
**three signals** that are native to GitHub:

| Signal | Meaning | How to set |
|--------|---------|------------|
| Issue is **open** with assignee = me | Work in progress | `gh issue edit --add-assignee @me` |
| **Draft PR** linked to the issue | Implementation done, validating | `gh pr create --draft` |
| **PR marked ready for review** | All gates passed; awaiting human merge | `gh pr ready` |

Add a single optional label `orchestrator-blocked` only when the orchestrator
needs human input mid-flight. The presence of that label is the only
"blocked" signal — its absence means work continues.

Create the label once in the repo:

```bash
gh label create orchestrator-blocked --description "Full-path orchestrator blocked on human input" --color B60205 --force
```

## Workflow

```text
Issue URL + Project
  │
  ├─ 0. Read guardrails.md                    ── Always first
  │
  ├─ 1. INTAKE (intake.md)                    ── assign issue to me
  │     Fetch issue, find code context,
  │     vagueness gate (what/where/verify)
  │     → blocked if too vague
  │
  ├─ 2. ENRICH (enrich.md)                    ── update issue body
  │     Pattern quality evaluation
  │     Grill-me self-interrogation
  │     Confidence-gated decisions
  │     → blocked if low-confidence (plan-first/auto mode)
  │
  ├─ 3. PLAN (plan.md)
  │     E2E hook check (build if missing)
  │     Structured-backlog decomposition
  │     Parallel group identification
  │
  ├─ 4. EXECUTE (execute.md)                  ── follow tdd-pocock per task
  │     Worktree set up via scaffold-workspace (if not already)
  │     Vertical-slice TDD: test→impl→test→impl
  │     Parallel groups via subagents (optional)
  │
  ├─ 5. VALIDATE (validate.md)
  │     Layer 1: Tests pass
  │     Layer 2: ACs verified
  │     Layer 3: code-review ≥ Solid
  │     Layer 4: E2E hooks pass (if applicable)
  │     → blocked if validation fails after retry
  │
  ├─ 6. SHIP (ship.md)                        ── draft PR → ready for review
  │     Push branch, create draft PR (gh-pr-create)
  │     Execution log in PR description
  │     Mark PR ready when validation green
  │
  └─ 7. RETROSPECT (retrospect.md)
        Analyze session friction
        Create skills for gaps found
        Write implementable refactor plans
```

## Execution

### Fresh Start

1. Read `phases/guardrails.md`
2. Read `phases/intake.md` — execute it
3. Read `phases/enrich.md` — execute it
4. Read `phases/plan.md` — execute it
5. Read `phases/execute.md` — execute it
6. Read `phases/validate.md` — execute it
7. Read `phases/ship.md` — execute it
8. Read `phases/retrospect.md` — execute it

At each phase transition, append to the execution log (a markdown buffer
the orchestrator carries through the run, embedded in the PR description
at SHIP time).

### Resume After Block

When the user says "resume the orchestrator on issue #NNN":

1. Fetch the issue: `gh issue view NNN --json title,body,labels,comments`
2. Read the latest comment to find the human's response to the blocking question
3. Look at whether a draft PR exists to know how far along the run got
4. Read `phases/guardrails.md`
5. Read the sub-skill for the blocked phase
6. Continue from where the phase stopped, incorporating the human's input
7. Remove the `orchestrator-blocked` label

### Resume mapping

| Signal | Resume from |
|--------|-------------|
| Issue assigned, no code context comment | `intake.md` |
| Issue body enriched, no draft PR | `enrich.md` or `plan.md` (check log) |
| Draft PR exists, tests failing | `execute.md` or `validate.md` |
| Draft PR exists, review fails | `validate.md` |

## Mode Reference

| Mode | When to use | Low-confidence behavior |
|------|-------------|------------------------|
| `plan-first` | Default. Architectural decisions, new features. | Write parallel plan sketches, ask human to pick. |
| `build-first` | Implementation-level uncertainty. | Build both options in parallel worktrees, compare in VALIDATE. |
| `auto` | Let the orchestrator decide. | Architectural → plan-first. Implementation → build-first. |

## Error Handling

| Error | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Issue is private and you don't have access | Stop. |
| Code context not found (intake) | Add `orchestrator-blocked` label, comment asking for pointers |
| Vagueness gate fails | Add `orchestrator-blocked` label, comment listing unanswerable questions |
| Low-confidence decision (enrich) | Mode-dependent: block or split |
| Tests fail after 2 attempts | Stop and report |
| `code-review` phase scores 0 after retry | Stop and report |
| E2E validation can't be built | Stop and report |
| `gh` CLI not authenticated | Stop and report |
| Sub-skill file missing | Stop and list what needs to be installed |

## Composition

This skill composes other skills — each remains usable independently:

```text
grill-me ─────────────┐
code-review ──────────┤
structured-backlog ───┤── full-path-github ──▶ PR
tdd-pocock ───────────┤
gh-pr-create ─────────┘
scaffold-workspace ──── (optional, for worktree setup)
```

## Predecessor

A GitHub issue exists (raw or groomed). For personal projects this is
typically your own brain dump — a sentence or two is fine; INTAKE will
flag if it's too vague to proceed.

## Successor

You review the PR. The orchestrator's execution log in the PR description
provides full context for self-review.

## Origin

Adapted from a private GitLab-flavored orchestrator. The TDD inner loop
in EXECUTE delegates to the [`tdd-pocock`](../tdd-pocock/) skill (Matt
Pocock's TDD skill, MIT-licensed, redistributed in this repo with
attribution).
